# Section 4 | Tutorial 2 | Tile Mapping

The goals for this tutorial are:

- to introduce [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and adding markers to tiled satellite maps. 
- to explore how to add external libraries and features to our applications. 
- to introduce public API tokens and their maintenance.

## Setup + Serve:

You should already have a local copy of your repository from the [tutorial 1](../1_1_getting_started/README.md). Start by getting a [basic server](../1_1_getting_started/3_BASIC_SERVER.md) up and running. This should include all the changes you've made thus far.

Once your local serve is up and reacting to code changes, you're ready to begin working on your tutorial assignment.
As you're building, don't forget you can always reference the [class code branch](https://github.com/InteractiveDataVis/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2023/tree/class/) or the [demo code branch](https://github.com/InteractiveDataVis/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2023/tree/demo/) for additional context.

## Assignment:

- [ ] Implement your own version of the mapbox map with your own public tokens on your site. 
- [ ] Add markers to the map. This can be leveraging the centroids of the countries of the MoMA dataset, the locations of the heat extremes, another dataset with coordinates, or a made up dataset. 
- [ ] Make intentional design decisions -- play with the custom map styles available to you. 

**BONUS:**

- [ ] Do the same with a [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map instead. 

## Deploy + Submit

>__CAUTION:__
Although these are public API keys, you should always use caution when adding API keys to your github. Make sure you're only using the public key, and its good practice to restrict your public key requests to your client side domain (in this case, github pages).

Once you've completed the assignment, use the Github workflow to deploy your work to **your fork** of the course repository. Post the following as a comment to the appropriate post on the [commons site](https://data73200Fall2023.commons.gc.cuny.edu/):
1. a link to your committed code repository (your link will look something like: `https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
2. a link to your deployed example (your link will look something like: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2023/[TUTORIAL_PATH]/`)
